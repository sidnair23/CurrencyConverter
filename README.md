# CurrencyConverter
This script was made as part of a project from CodeAcademy. It asks the user who recently arrived came back from Latin America about the total value in different currencies he/she holds and converts those into USD

Note: Currency rates as of September 22nd 2019

V2: In the Python version of the currency converter, the scope of the initial project was increased dramatically. Using the forex-python library, this script can now:
1) Perform Currency Conversion
2) Provide Currency Exchange Rate
3) Perform BitCoin Conversion
4) Provide BitCoin Exchange Rate
